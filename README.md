# FAQ

## WTF? Why you create such an ugly extension?

Please ask Apple why they create such an ugly notch on their laptop.

## I don't think this is funny and I think Apple already gives us the best solution…

I might agree with those Apple fans if I never seen the new Dell XPS 15.

## XPS 15's camera is smaller, but Apple cares users' image quality…

Then I have a more Apple-ish way: I'd like to sell an accessory called **iCamera**, which could be connected to your laptop with a USB-C adapter. You get a full monitor and the best image quality (compared with all built-in cameras), and Apple gets money (maybe I could get an offer from Apple too).

PS Before the release of new Macbook Pro, I was thinking about making a one-key external USB-C keyboard called **iEsc** and selling it to my friend who is suffering from Touchbar because of no Esc when using Vim.

It's silly? But who removed 3.5mm headphone jack and gives you a Lightning to 3.5mm jack adapter? (Firstly they said removing 3.5mm jack is to place bigger Haptics Engine for 3D Touch, but in 2021 we all know that **3D Touch is dead, as well as Touchbar**).

## It covers my clock!

This is the same behavior as hardware notch. Don't ask Apple to do things for developers, but ask developers to do things for Apple! So write your own code to modify your software.

## My cursor disappears when it enters the notch!

This is the same behavior as hardware notch.

## It only shows on my primary monitor!

Yes, because no monitor manufacturer will add such a silly notch to their monitors, except Apple's internal monitor.

## Can this improve security?

Yes! There is no physical camera inside this extension, so it's even **safer** than the FaceTime 1080P HD camera which contains a physical camera that can be controlled by hackers!

## Should I use this extension?

If you plan to betray free software and consecrate all your money to an evil system, yes.

## This is not 100% the same as the Apple one!

If you love the Apple notch so much, you Apple fans just go to buy a real one!

## Your notch has a fixed size of 250x60, which is bigger than my whole screen!

Please ask Apple to make their camera smaller, I believe Apple will ask you to buy a bigger monitor in this case.

## This is a useless extension. Are you a useless developer?

No, I never do development on Apple platform, also check [Fixed IME List](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/gnome-shell-extension-fixed-ime-list/), [Always Show Workspace Thumbnails](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/gnome-shell-extension-always-show-workspace-thumbnails/) and [Net Speed](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/gnome-shell-extension-net-speed/) for my useful extensions.
